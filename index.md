of Computing of the UEF. Contact teaching takes place at the Joensuu campus of the UEF from August 12th to 16th.

<!--The first day includes course introduction, introduction to machine
learning, linear mixed models and basics of deep learning for modeling
sequential data. The next two days focus on audio topics (speaker &

steganography), while the last two lecture days focus on reinforcement
learning and autonomous software and physical agents (robots).-->

The course is intended as a brief introduction to reinforcement learning and its application to different game applications. It provides an introduction to reinforcement learning, starting from the basics and ending up with advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning for video games. The course will involve lectures, practicals, project and and learning diary. While no formal pre-requirements are set, sufficient programming knowledge of Python, certain level of mathematics/statistics and neural network will be helpful for the maximum benefit of the participant.
