## Course Overview
University of Eastern Finland (UEF) hosts a number of different summer
courses in August 2018. The course on Machine Learning Applied to
Speech Technology and Autonomous Agents is co-organized by the School
of Computing of the UEF and  Department of Automation and Systems
Technology of Aalto University. Contact teaching takes place from
August 13th to 17th, 2018. Individual optional project work is from
August 20th to 24th, 2018.

The course is intended to be self-contained with limited or no prior
knowledge of machine learning required. It gives a brief overview of
the relevant machine learning concepts and their applications to
speech technology and autonomous agents. Despite the two different
application themes, there are no parallel sessions but the
participants learn about both topics.

The first day includes course introduction, introduction to machine
learning, linear mixed models and basics of deep learning for modeling
sequential data. The next two days focus on audio topics (speaker &
speech recognition, speaker diarization, speech enhancement, audio
steganography), while the last two lecture days focus on reinforcement
learning and autonomous software and physical agents (robots). The
teaching takes place at the Joensuu campus of the UEF.

The speech portion of the course is especially recommended for PhD
students (and MSc students close to graduation) who might be already
familiar with the basics of signal processing and are interested in
obtaining a brief overview of basic principles, state-of-the-art
techniques and selected emerging trends, especially in speaker and
language recognition.

The reinforcement portion of the course gives basics of how autonomous
agents, whether physical (robots) or software, can be designed and
trained in end-to-end fashion. Portion of the course is useful for any
PhD or MSc students close to graduation, who is interested to learn
more about the state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence (AI).
