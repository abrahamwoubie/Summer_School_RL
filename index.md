## Course Content
#### **Fundamentals of Machine Learning**

In the first two days of the course we will focus on the topics such as deep learning models,
Bayesian graphical models and modeling sequential data. But as no previous knowledge of the
machine learning is required to enroll to this course we will also give an introductory lectures on
the basics of machine learning.

#### **Speech Processing**
In the speech/audio track we focus on state-of-the-art automatic speaker verification (ASV) and
language identication (LID) technology. In addition to introducing the basic models and software
tools for session/channel compensation to increase robustness (e.g. factor analysis and
i-vectors), the topics include also audio forensics and speech anti-spoofing (or presentation
attack detection) techniques, including the ASVspoof challenge series. Using these techniques
system would be able to know whether recorded audio was tampered somehow or that the
spoken by a human or produced by a machine. Open-source software tools will also be
introduced.

The speech track is recommended especially for PhD students (and MSc students close to
graduation) already familiar with the basics of speech processing, and interested in obtaining a
general overview of both basic principles and selected emerging trends in speaker and
language recognition. Lectures by:

- Cemal Hanilci, Bursa Technical University, Turkey
- Ville Hautamäki, University of Eastern Finland, Finland
- Tomi Kinnunen, University of Eastern Finland, Finland
- Kong Aik Lee,  Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore

#### **Bioinformatics**
The bioinformatics track will include an overview of the data types encountered in the field of biomedicine, 
both from imaging-based analysis and omics profiles. Brain MRI image data will be presented as 
advanced methods application from biomedical image analysis. In parallel, single
cell genomics data and models will be introduced to exemplify applications to molecular data.

The track will also introduce the concept of multiscale learning since an important future goal in
the field is to bring the data obtained from tissue imaging together with molecular network
models. Lectures by:

- Jussi Tohka, University of Eastern Finland, Finland
- Merja Heinäniemi, University of Eastern Finland, Finland
- Pekka Ruusuvuori, University of Tampere
- Thanneer Perumal, Sage Bionetworks, USA

## Practical Assignments
The second week of the course consists of independent work. These tasks have been set up in collaboration with Sage Bionetworks and Synapse to challenge the students to develop solutions to three real world problems: i) modeling speech recordings to classify Parkinson's disease patients and to utilize ii) imaging and iii) single cell gene expression data to distinguish changes occurring during Alzheimer's disease.
