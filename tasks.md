### Return submission on Moodle: [https://moodle.uef.fi/course/view.php?id=17032](https://moodle.uef.fi/course/view.php?id=17032)

## Learning diary
Deadline: 8.9.2017 <br>
Returnables: Filled learning diary (questions answered) <br>
Filled learning diary will be returned to the Moodle (link will be added later).

For the first week of the course, participants are required to submit filled
learning diary that consists of different questions related to given lectures. 

You can find the learning diary on "Course Notes" section. Current version 
on the site is the final version.

## Project (done during second week, 21.8 - 25.8, and onward)
Deadline: 8.9.2017 <br>
Returnables: Final report and source code <br>
Report and source code will be returned to the Moodle (link will be added later).

Second week will consist of working on a pre-defined project/task, writing a
report with theory, methodology, experiment setup and final results as well as returning source code produced. 

There will be tutoring sessions on the second week of the summer school where
TA's will be answering and assisting you with your projects. There will also be 
an IRC chat (see "Chat" tab, available during second week) where you can ask questions outside tutoring sessions. 

*Note from TAs: We are not top-experts in these areas and the tasks are quite fresh/new/open problems. As such, do not expect pre-made solutions or 100% correct suggestions from us :)*

**Note: Accessing required datasets requires certified Synapse account. See "Dataset" page**

Projects can be one of the following (one per person): 

- Single Cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq)
    - [Check more information here]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/rnaseq)
    - The aim is to predicttheproportion of different cell types from bulk RNASeq using clever approach utilizing data from single cell RNASeq -> cell type deconvolution problem
    - Challenge: Can you come up with a clever way to utilize scRNAseq to deconvolve the signal in the Alzheimer brain tissue samples?
- Detecting Parkinson's Disease (PD) using speech data
    - [Synapse page](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4993293/wiki/)
    - Task is to use speech data ‘/aaaa/’ sound to predict whether speaker has PD or not. 
    - Speakers used iphone app to self collect the data. Large number of speakers and samples are available (> 50k samples). 
    - We will pre-select samples for training, validation and test sets. We will give the baseline performance on the test set and hope is that students will come up with novel ideas which exceed the baseline performance. 
    - Finally, the interesting thing is to see what features in the speech are predictive of the PD. This can lead to new biology and possibly practical diagnostic tools.
    - **Note: This data requires *validated* Synapse account, which requires signed letters from your institute ( [Check Steps 3-5  here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4993293/wiki/247860) )**
