## Learning diary
Deadline: TBA (after second week of summer school) <br>
Returnables: Filled learning diary (questions answered)

For the first week of the course, participants are required to submit filled
learning diary that consists of different questions related to given lectures. 

You can find the learning diary on "Course Notes" section. **Note that it might be
updated during first week,** but you can start working on questions already included.

## Project (done during second week, 21.8 - 25.8, and onward)
Deadline: TBA (after second week of summer school) <br>
Returnables: Final report and source code

Second week will consist of working on a pre-defined project, writing
final report with final results as well as returning source code produced.

**Note: Accessing required datasets requires certified Synapse account. See "Dataset" page**

Project task can be chosen from the following: 

- Single Cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq)
    - The aim is to predicttheproportion of different cell types from bulk RNASeq using clever approach utilizing data from single cell RNASeq -> cell type deconvolution problem
    - Challenge: Can you come up with a clever way to utilize scRNAseq to deconvolve the signal in the Alzheimer brain tissue samples?
- Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization
    - The aim is to perform automated image annotation to find out which cell types/tissue substructures express the genes that change their level in Alzheimer’s disease patients (RNA-seq profiles)
    - Challenge: Can you come up with a clever way to utilize Allen Brain Atlas data to link the gene expression changes in the Alzheimer brain to specific brain regions?
- Detecting Parkinson's Disease (PD) using speech data
    - Task is to use speech data ‘/aaaa/’ sound to predict whether speaker has PD or not. 
    - Speakers used iphone app to self collect the data. Large number of speakers and samples are available (> 50k samples). 
    - We will pre-select samples for training, validation and test sets. We will give the baseline performance on the test set and hope is that students will come up with novel ideas which exceed the baseline performance. 
    - Finally, the interesting thing is to see what features in the speech are predictive of the PD. This can lead to new biology and possibly practical diagnostic tools.
    - **Note: This data requires *validated* Synapse account, which requires signed letters from your institute (Check Synapse about validating the account)**
